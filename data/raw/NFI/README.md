## Steps for Raw Data File Conversion

1. Clone the NFI GitHub repository locally.
2. Create a python script that:
    - Reads in each CSV file
    - Concatenates the Particle files together into a single table
    - Joins all tables together into a single table, using Particle ID as the Primary Key.
    - Writes the final raw table to a compressed Parquet format.
3. Run the python script.
4. Copy the script & Parquet output file to our project repository.
